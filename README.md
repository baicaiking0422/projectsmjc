# project-smjc
We implemented a second hand shopping website for shoes and clothes, where users can sell and purchase items.

# main-page
Main page displays the items on sale and the top navigation bar. Users can log in when clicking sign in button or sign up. When they click on the item picture, they are redirected to a product detailed page. There, they can buy the item or chat with the seller.

Once they log in, they will see a user info button on the top. Or an admin button if they are admin.

#user-info page
Users once click the user info button they will be redirected to this page. This page has a navigation bar on the right. When they click "edit personal info", a form will be shown. They can edit their password, email, phone and other personal info.
The "sold items & items on sale" button will display a table of the items the user sells. This table has attributes of name, price and size. The purchase history button display the same table as the sold one except the goods are purchased by this user.
The "want to rate" button can dispaly a table of purchased but not rated goods. When clicking rata button, the user will be led to the rating page of this item.
Wallet button means the user can charge money to our system, just like pay pal and Ali Pay.
Add goods button is for the user to sell an other item to the web page. It will be linked to the add goods page.
