üëã Hello, here is some (hopefully) helpful feedback to help position your group to do well on the final project, from the perspective of a TA..

## Overall, At First Glance
The idea is good, but the proposal looks like there are too many features to implement for the given time. It seems like the scope of the project is too large and will not be completed on time. It's surprising how quickly time flies in this project. So, I recommend omitting many of the user features, and don't worry if the group doesn't have time for many of them. 

## Reassurance/Encouragement/Suggestions
I should also provide reassurance that it's OKAY to not implement certain things. Here are some examples of features that could be omitted without losing marks:
- Processing the payments is beyond the scope so instead there can be a buy button that just saves the item for the user, or something simple like that.
- If it seems overly time-intensive to implement a system to manage user's photos on the server, it's okay to just use a generic placeholder instead of implementing this functionality.
- The chat feature can be a simple messaging, without being "live" and without notifications.

Hopefully these suggestions will help guide the thinking of ways to be efficient to complete the project on time. As a general rule, it's better to omit non-core features that are time-intensive, with some explanation in the final documentation like, "in a full version of the application, we would also add the following features..." than it is to have some half-implemented bits and pieces in an app.

As you already know, one of the most important things for a successful outcome is to divide the tasks amongst team members well, and to decide what things are unimportant to submit as part of the "minimum viable product" approach for this final project. I recommend choosing the features to omit, and diving up this work as soon as possible, if it hasn't already been done üëç 

The omitted features can be worked on later as a side project, on top of the "minimum viable product", if there is ever free time after the course :-)

Bootstrap (or other similar) may be helpful to use for the components by eliminating the need to reinvent the wheel (building standard components from scratch). And it saves time (and your sanity) rather than having to fiddle with things like background color, and shadows, when there is lots more work to be done implementing important features of the app.
