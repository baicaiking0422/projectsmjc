	Overall we will implement a second hand shopping website for shoes and clothes, where users can sell and purchase items. This website serves people who like to online shop for second hand clothes, and/or  sell items they own. To be more specific, users are able to search for items in a search bar using key words, or use a filter to select the price range, the size, or the colour of the items of interest (we might add other features for the filter). Further, the user can also navigate the database of items by category (dress, pants, shorts, skirts, etc.). When the user found an item they would like to purchase, they are able to add the item to a shopping cart, and in the end pay for all the items in the cart. Contrarily, sellers can also sell their second hand items online by uploading a picture or pictures as they like, and they have to enter a price and add a description (such as adding size and colour tags) for the item. Moreover, users can comment under any item and be able to give ratings. Similarly, the sellers can respond to the buyersâ€™ comments. In terms of user authentication and authorization, the user can choose to login or sign in to the website. Items can only be purchased if the buyer has logged in to his/her account.
